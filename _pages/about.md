Hi, there! 👋🏼

I'm an electronic engineer working with embedded systems. I also spend some time working on some random personal projects in Python, Javascript, etc.

I created this personal blog to have a place where I can post some electronic/programming related articles, specially because I needed a place to keep tutorials
that could be eventually useful for myself in the future 🧠.
